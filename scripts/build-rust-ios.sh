#   scripts/build-rust-ios.sh [device] [profile]

#   profile: release-dev (default, fast) or release (shipping)

# Safe to invoke from anywhere, including inside `nix develop` — the script
# re-execs itself in a scrubbed environment (see below) before doing any work.

# Simulator (aarch64-apple-ios-sim) is intentionally unsupported — see
# ios/Flutter/Rust.xcconfig for the explanation.

# iOS cross-compilation needs Apple's toolchain and rustup's iOS rust-std, and
# gets neither inside `nix develop`: the Nix shell ships an `xcrun`/`clang` that
# only know Nix's macOS SDK (exit 255 on `--sdk iphoneos`), a Rust toolchain
# without iOS targets, and a CARGO_TARGET_DIR pointing at the repo root — which
# silently strands the .a somewhere ios/Flutter/Rust.xcconfig never looks.
#
# Unsetting variables one by one loses that race every time a new one appears
# (CARGO_TARGET_DIR, LIBCLANG_PATH, CC, RUSTFLAGS, ...), so re-exec with an
# allowlisted environment instead. Nothing from the caller survives except the
# few things cargo and Xcode genuinely need.
#
# DEVELOPER_DIR is the one value read from the caller, so CI can pin an Xcode
# with actions/setup-xcode, which works by setting it. It is validated first,
# not trusted: `nix develop` also exports a DEVELOPER_DIR, pointing at its own
# macOS-only SDK, and forwarding that makes every iOS build fail on a confusing
# "xcrun cannot find the iOS SDK".
