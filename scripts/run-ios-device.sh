# Build the Rust static library and run the Flutter app on a connected iOS device.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run-ios-device.sh [extra flutter run args...]
#
#   IOS_DEVICE_ID=<udid>       target a specific device
#   IOS_RUST_PROFILE=release   build the Rust lib with the shipping profile
#
# This is the direct entry point — it needs neither `just` nor `nix develop`
# (`just` only exists inside the Nix shell, which is the one environment iOS
# cross-compilation cannot use). The script re-execs itself in a scrubbed
# environment, so invoking it from inside `nix develop` is also fine.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Xcode + Command Line Tools
#   - CocoaPods (`brew install cocoapods`)
#   - Flutter (`brew install flutter`)
#   - rustup with `aarch64-apple-ios` target installed
#   - cmake (`brew install cmake`) and bindgen-cli (`cargo install --locked bindgen-cli`)
#   - A connected, unlocked iOS device, trusted, with Developer Mode enabled
#     (Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode)
#   - A signing team in ios/Flutter/Local.xcconfig (gitignored; see Debug.xcconfig)
